## Case study 1

This case studies will serve to introduce the implementation of very simple case studies, where in most of the case, a closed-form expression can be used to calculate the sample size. They will help the user to understand the specificity of the Mediana Package with simple examples.

2.  [Trial with two treatment arms and single endpoint (binary endpoint).](CaseStudy01.html#Binaryendpoint)
3.  [Trial with two treatment arms and single endpoint (survival-type endpoint).](CaseStudy01.html#Survival-typeendpoint)
4.  [Trial with two treatment arms and single endpoint (survival-type endpoint with censoring).](CaseStudy01.html#Survival-typeendpoint(withcensoring))
5.  [Trial with two treatment arms and single endpoint (count-type endpoint).](CaseStudy01.html#Count-typeendpoint)

## Case study 2

This case study will serve to introduce a clinical trial with settings where a multiplicity adjustment is required and no analytical methods are available to support power calculations.

This example will also illustrate a key feature of the Mediana package, the possibility to define user-specified function, for example, to define a new criterion for the Evaluation Model.
