# Biography
Gautier Paux has been working as a biostatistician for a mid-pharma in France since 2012 where he is responsible for Phase I to III clinical trials in Oncology. He received his MSc in biostatistics in 2010 from the National School for Statistics and Information Analysis in France. Following his graduation, he has worked at Sanofi Pasteur in the US for 18 months where he provided statistical support for vaccine clinical trials. His interests in biostatistics include multiplicity issues in clinical trials, subgroup analysis and clinical trial simulations/optimization. He has actively collaborated with international experts, including publications on development of gatekeeping procedures and power calculations in clinical trials with complex clinical objectives. In December 2014, he has (jointly with Alex Dmitrienko) presented a webinar for the American Statistical Association entitled "From sample size calculation to clinical trial optimization". He has also actively contributed to the development of open-source software tools, including the MultXpert R package, which implements commonly used multiplicity adjustments, and is now playing a leading role in the development of the Mediana R package, which provides a standardized approach to clinical trial simulations.

# Papers

# R package
* **[multxpert](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multxpert/index.html)**: Implementation of commonly used p-value-based and parametric multiple testing procedures (computation of adjusted p-values and simultaneous confidence intervals) and parallel gatekeeping procedures based on the methodology presented in the book "Multiple Testing Problems in Pharmaceutical Statistics" (edited by Alex Dmitrienko, Ajit C. Tamhane and Frank Bretz) published by Chapman and Hall/CRC Press 2009.
* **[Mediana](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Mediana/index.html)**: Provides a general framework for clinical trial simulations based on the Clinical Scenario Evaluation (CSE) approach. The package supports a broad class of data models (including clinical trials with continuous, binary, survival-type and count-type endpoints as well as multivariate outcomes that are based on combinations of different endpoints), analysis strategies and commonly used evaluation criteria.
