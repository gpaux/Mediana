Description: Provides a general framework for clinical trial simulations based
    on the Clinical Scenario Evaluation (CSE) approach. The package supports a
    broad class of data models (including clinical trials with continuous, binary,
    survival-type and count-type endpoints as well as multivariate outcomes that are
    based on combinations of different endpoints), analysis strategies and commonly
    used evaluation criteria.
