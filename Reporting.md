## About


## Initialization

A presentation model can be initialized using the following command
{% highlight R %}
# PresentationModel initialization
presentation.model = PresentationModel()
{% endhighlight %}

Initialization with this command is higlhy recommended as it will simplify the add of related objects, such as 
`Project`, `Section`, `Subsection`, `Table`, `CustomLabel` objects.
